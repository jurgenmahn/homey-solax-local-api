# Solax-G3-Local-WiFi

Support for local Solax G3 inverters using the WiFi dongle with local connection and API instead of the cloud connection.

Special thanks to https://github.com/squishykid/solax who did all of the hard work to reverse engineer all inverter API responses, i just ported it to Homey / NodeJS
